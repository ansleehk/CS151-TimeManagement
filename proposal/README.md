## Issue to solve
In today's fast-paced world, time management is more important than ever before, and students are no exception. With academic and social responsibilities constantly competing for their attention, it is easy for students to feel overwhelmed and struggle to stay organized. This can lead to missed deadlines, forgotten assignments, and a general feeling of stress and anxiety.

As a result, there is a clear need for a reliable and effective time management software that can help students better manage their schedules and priorities. In the past, students have often relied on traditional methods such as paper planners and to-do lists. However, these methods can be cumbersome and difficult to keep up with, particularly in today's digital age.

Furthermore, students today face unique challenges that previous generations did not. For example, they may be juggling multiple part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, and social media distractions, all while trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This makes it all the more important to have a time management software that can help students stay on top of their tasks and obligations, while also providing them with the flexibility and convenience they need to adapt to their changing schedules.

Therefore, the proposed time management software would be an invaluable tool for students of all ages and backgrounds. By leveraging the latest technology and proven time management techniques, it will help students optimize their schedules, prioritize their tasks, and stay focused and productive throughout the day. With the help of this software, students will be better equipped to meet their academic goals, excel in their extracurricular activities, and enjoy a more balanced and fulfilling life overall.

## Solution w/ Functionality
Similar to how we humans like to start a morning routine after waking up, we hope using our application becomes apart of the user's routine. We want to help the user actively plan out their day and reduce any amount of stress that may occur from having too many events to participate in. This application will follow a calender based format in which activities and events will appear to help the user get a general plan of how they're day is going to go. 

## Operations
Upon opening the application the user will be greeted with a login/signup page in which they create or login to an account. 

When the user signs up for an account, general information will be asked about the user such as their name, date of birth, email, etc. Once the user fills these out, they'll be asked to fill out timeslots that relate to what all humans do (wake up, sleep, eat, etc). This is so we can get a rough idea of when the user start/end their day. 

After filling that out, they'll be asked if they have any common activities or events that occur daily, weekly, etc. The user will be able to checkbox the days of the week in which the activity occurs, it's priority level on a scale on 1-5, and either a scheduled timeslot or the amount of time they want to spend on that activity. Additionally, we'd want the user to include daily events and activities that aren't normally considered ones someone wouldn't include in their plan. Examples include how much or what time they want to play videogames, hang out with friends, meal prep, gardening, etc. This helps us because we can get an idea of how the user wants to spend their day to where we can organize both activities they want to do and activities they'll eventually add later on.

Afterwards, the user will then be shown their own calender, organized with the events/actions they previously answered. The user will be able to see their calender in either a day, week, or month format. Buttons are also present in which the user can either mark one or all event(s) in either ending/cancelling the event early or adding more time. Another button is available for the user to add a new event where it asks the same format as before (name of event, when or how often it occurs, priority level, and time slot/time wanting to spend on that event). Upon finishing either actions, the calender will automatically update depending on the action they chose, while considering the time slots and time requested from already present events.
