## Issue to solve
In today's fast-paced world, time management is more important than ever before, and students are no exception. With academic and social responsibilities constantly competing for their attention, it is easy for students to feel overwhelmed and struggle to stay organized. This can lead to missed deadlines, forgotten assignments, and a general feeling of stress and anxiety.

As a result, there is a clear need for a reliable and effective time management software that can help students better manage their schedules and priorities. In the past, students have often relied on traditional methods such as paper planners and to-do lists. However, these methods can be cumbersome and difficult to keep up with, particularly in today's digital age.

Furthermore, students today face unique challenges that previous generations did not. For example, they may be juggling multiple part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, and social media distractions, all while trying to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This makes it all the more important to have a time management software that can help students stay on top of their tasks and obligations, while also providing them with the flexibility and convenience they need to adapt to their changing schedules.

Therefore, the proposed time management software would be an invaluable tool for students of all ages and backgrounds. By leveraging the latest technology and proven time management techniques, it will help students optimize their schedules, prioritize their tasks, and stay focused and productive throughout the day. With the help of this software, students will be better equipped to meet their academic goals, excel in their extracurricular activities, and enjoy a more balanced and fulfilling life overall.

## Solution w/ Functionality
Similar to how we humans like to start a morning routine after waking up, we hope using our application becomes apart of the user's routine. We want to help the user actively plan out their day and reduce any amount of stress that may occur from having too many events to participate in. This application will follow a calender based format in which activities and events will appear in. It's our job to help the user organize events and activities based on their time length and priority so they can have a general plan on how they're day is going to be. 

## Operations
- Upon opening the application, the user will be greeted with a login/signup page.
- Users will create or login to an account by providing general information, such as their name, date of birth, email, etc.
- Users will be asked to fill out timeslots that relate to common human activities, such as waking up, sleeping, eating, etc., to give a rough idea of their daily schedule.
- Users will be prompted to indicate any common activities or events that occur daily, weekly, etc.
- Users can checkbox the days of the week when the activity occurs, indicate its priority level on a scale of 1-5, and choose a scheduled timeslot or the amount of time they want to spend on that activity.
- Users can also include daily events and activities that may not be typically considered when planning a schedule, such as playing videogames, hanging out with friends, meal prepping, gardening, etc.
- The above information helps to organize both the activities users want to do and the activities they may add later on.
- After completing the above steps, users will see their own calendar, organized with the events and actions they previously entered.
- Users can view their calendar in a day, week, or month format.
- Buttons are present that allow users to mark one or all events for ending or canceling an event early or adding more time.
- A button is also available for users to add a new event, where they will provide the same information as before (name of the event, when or how often it occurs, priority level, and time slot/time they want to spend on that event).
- Upon finishing any of the above actions, the calendar will automatically update while considering the time slots and time requested from already present events.
